## Update 12/13/2015
- The application has been totally revamped to focus on just tracking goals for each individual member.  The front page was redone to look more like a landing page, and the member pages were revamped to be just health and fitness trackers.

## Tech Used

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- CSS/HTML/ERB
- Heroku (for hosting)
- Github (for organizing and version control)

## Approach Taken

I first planned out some wireframes (linked below) to figure out what components I wanted to have on my website.  After that, I did some brainstorming on who would be using the website and how they would interact with it.

I then placed some basic rails elements on my home page and my member pages. From there, I was able to incrementally add more detail, links, interaction, functionality, and style as elements were completed.

## Installation Instructions

1. Create a profile by clicking the sign up link when you visit the website.  That'll create an account for you.  
2. Once you've done that, login.
3. Add tweets from the home page, make personal journal entries on your profile page, edit your stats on your profile page, and read the articles on the home page.
4. Enjoy!

## Unsolved problems
